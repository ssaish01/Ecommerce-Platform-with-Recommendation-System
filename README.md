# E-commerce Platform with Recommendation System

This project is an end-to-end e-commerce platform featuring a recommendation system. Built with modern web technologies, it provides a dynamic and user-friendly interface for browsing and purchasing products, while also offering personalized product recommendations. The recommendation engine leverages machine learning to suggest products based on user behavior or product content.

## Key Features

### Frontend
- React: The user interface is built using React for a dynamic, component-based structure.
- State Management: Redux is used for managing application state, allowing for smooth interactions across components.
- Routing: React Router handles navigation between pages, ensuring a seamless experience for users.
  
### Backend
- Python & Django: The backend is powered by Python and Django, providing a robust RESTful API to handle requests from the frontend.
  
### User Authentication
- JWT Authentication: Secure user authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensuring safe user sessions.
- OAuth: Alternatively, OAuth is integrated to allow users to sign in using external services like Google or Facebook.

### E-commerce Features
- Product Catalog: A comprehensive list of products available for sale, with detailed descriptions, prices, and images.
- Shopping Cart: Users can add products to their shopping cart and proceed to checkout.
- Order History: Users can view their order history, track their purchases, and repeat past orders with ease.

### Recommendation System
- Machine Learning Integration: The system uses machine learning models (e.g., collaborative filtering or content-based recommendation) to suggest relevant products based on user preferences and activity. Scikit-learn is utilized for implementing the recommendation algorithm.

### Real-time Notifications
- WebSockets: Real-time notifications is integrated using either WebSockets, enabling live updates on order status or interaction with customer support.

## How It Works

1. Frontend: 
   - The frontend is built with React, where users can browse products, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout.
   - Redux manages the application state, ensuring that the cart and user sessions are synchronized across different components.
   - React Router allows navigation between various pages, such as the homepage, product catalog, and user profile.
   
2. Backend: 
   - The backend handles all API requests, such as user authentication, product details, and order management.
   - User authentication is managed using JWT tokens, ensuring secure login and registration flows. OAuth is also supported for external login options.
   
3. Recommendation System: 
   - The recommendation engine analyzes user interactions and browsing history to suggest products that are likely to be of interest.
   - The system can be personalized based on content-based filtering (attributes of the products themselves).
   
4. Real-Time Notifications:
   - WebSockets are used to deliver real-time notifications about order status, promotions, or chat messages.
   - This provides an interactive and engaging experience for users, keeping them informed throughout their shopping journey.
